      "I created a unique radio show during an incredible 20-day trip to the stunning Garo Hills of Meghalaya! With my mic and a sense of adventure, I explored local music schools and homes, meeting some incredible artisans who make bamboo instruments. I recorded their rare, beautiful sounds and learned about their rich culture. It was all about capturing the spirit of a timeless musical tradition. From hanging out with some of the oldest artisans still crafting bamboo instruments, I got an insider look (and listen) into the Garo tribe's world. Their music, history, and culture were too rich not to share, so I recorded everything and brought it all to life—yes, even those quirky bamboo tunes!",

    description: "This documentary shines a spotlight on Mr. Deepak Chandra, the incredible head chef at OP Jindal University. In his late 30s, Deepak leads a team of over 100 chefs, ensuring 8,700 students are fed four meals daily—talk about responsibility! The short film follows his daily routine and shows what running such a huge kitchen is like. Deepak’s been working with Sodexo for over five years, while his family—his wife, 10-year-old son, and 4-year-old daughter—live in his beautiful hometown of Haldwani, nestled in the mountains of Nainital, India.",

      "This panel discussion was inspired by a landmark ruling from the Indian Supreme Court on April 22, 2023, which allowed the abortion of a 30-week fetus—quite in contrast to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade. The panel dives into the political and cultural reasons behind these differing rulings in both countries. As the producer, I brought together a diverse group of guests, including a professor who studied at USC and worked in California for ten years and a church priest with a decade of experience who's also a Catholic school principal. The conversation was expertly moderated by a fellow student with a deep understanding of the topic.",

      "This documentary is inspired by SOCH (Social Organisation for Conquering Hunger), a unique NGO started by 15 retired army officers in New Delhi to help those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. SOCH spreads the word across the city, letting people know they can reach out for support if someone can’t provide ID or proof of address. SOCH steps in and visits them personally to offer help. From daily rations to connecting people with job opportunities, they’ve got it covered! The film highlights Veeravati, a woman with polio who gets around on an electric scooter and builds her home on the streets. She’s married with a 6-year-old son, and while her husband works in another city, SOCH founder Mr Agrawal has provided her with ration support for the last three years.",
